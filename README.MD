# ☕ Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and practicing Java. This space contains code snippets, exercises, and mini-projects as I work through the fundamentals of Java and progressively advance toward real-world backend development and DSA mastery.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Solidify Java fundamentals and OOP principles
- Practice common algorithms and data structures
- Build Java-based projects using real-world tools like Spring Boot
- Prepare for coding interviews and backend development

---

## ✅ Current Progress Snapshot

> Phase 1: Core Java  
> Status: 🚧 In Progress  
> ✔️ Basics, control flow, and type casting completed  
> ⏳ Currently learning: methods and object-oriented programming

---

## 📘 Learning Roadmap

### 📗 Phase 1: Core Java (Foundational Knowledge)
- ✅ Java setup & Hello World
- ✅ Variables, Data Types, Type Casting
- ✅ Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, etc.)
- ✅ Control Flow: `if/else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- ✅ `break`, `continue`
- ⏳ Methods (declaration, overloading, recursion)
- ⏳ OOP: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction

---

### 📘 Phase 2: Intermediate Java (Problem-Solving Focus)
- 🔜 Arrays & Strings (1D/2D, manipulation, practice problems)
- 🔜 ArrayList & LinkedList
- 🔜 Stacks, Queues, Deque (Java Collections & custom implementations)
- 🔜 HashMap, HashSet, TreeMap
- 🔜 Recursion & Backtracking challenges

---

### 📘 Phase 3: Advanced Java (DSA & Real-World Readiness)
- 🔜 Sorting & Searching algorithms
- 🔜 Bit Manipulation techniques
- 🔜 Mathematics for DSA (prime numbers, modular math)
- 🔜 Exception Handling (`try-catch`, custom exceptions)
- 🔜 File I/O & Object Serialization

---

### 📘 Phase 4: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA Mastery)
- 🔜 Trees (BST, traversal, heaps)
- 🔜 Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- 🔜 Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, matrix problems)

---

### 📘 Phase 5: Java Ecosystem & Spring Boot
- 🔜 Maven/Gradle for dependency management
- 🔜 Spring Core: DI, IoC, Beans
- 🔜 Spring Boot (REST APIs, configuration, validation)
- 🔜 Spring Data JPA (entities, repositories, relationships)
- 🔜 (Optional) Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2)

---

### 📘 Phase 6: Practical Application & Projects
- 🔜 Mini Projects: Blog API, Task Manager, CRUD apps
- 🔜 Competitive coding on: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces
